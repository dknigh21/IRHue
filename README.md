# IRHue
Small program to connect Phillips Hue lights to iRacing using phue and pyirsdk.

Dependencies: 

pyirsdk:	https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk
phue:		https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue

This setup currently uses 3 Hue lights, stored in array "lights". Bridge.lights from Phue will return an array of all lights, so just edit the code accordingly.
